## Specification

This amendment MIP proposes to eliminate any reference to a facilitator as "individual" and replace it by the term  "person".

### Motivation

- MIP 41 defines Facilitators as "accountable individuals". 
  The term individual is defined as "a single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution" (Merriam Webster Dictionary)
  The term person is more broad and can include collective bodies, legal entities, and fictitious characters which pseudonymous identities.

- This MIP proposes to change a very speicific term, a MIP replacement is not necessary.

- Any impact this has on other MIPs that interact with the MIP in question.
